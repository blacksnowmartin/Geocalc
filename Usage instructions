Usage
Go to Google My Maps and create a custom map.

Outline the area you want to measure using the drawing tools available in Google My Maps.

Save your map, and then export it as a KML file. To do this, click on the three dots (menu) next to your map's name, then select "Export to KML/KMZ."

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded this repository.

Run the following command, replacing "path/to/your/exported.kml" with the actual path to your exported KML file:

bash
Copy code
python calculate_area.py path/to/your/exported.kml
This script will read the KML file and calculate the approximate area in square kilometers.

Example
bash
Copy code
python calculate_area.py path/to/your/exported.kml
Note
The program provides an approximation of the area, and the accuracy may vary depending on the complexity of the outlined area and the projection used in the KML file.
